"""Refine Stage A section types using per-stem song-form signals.

Stage A (``section_naming.derive_section_types``) maps H2 role
decisions onto a minimal vocabulary —
INTRO/VERSE/CHORUS/BRIDGE/OUTRO — using chord-trigram recurrence
plus position. Stage B (this module) takes that output and refines
it using per-section aggregates from
``song_form_aggregates.aggregate_song_form``:

    CHORUS + vocal_activity_score < ceiling
        → INSTRUMENTAL

    VERSE + next is CHORUS + energy_ramp_into_next > floor
        → PRECHORUS

    drum_density_z < ceiling   (and not at the song's edge)
        → BREAKDOWN

    transition.to_section's refined type is CHORUS
        + aggregates[from_section].energy_ramp_into_next > floor
        → transition.type = "buildup"

All four rules are conservative one-sided thresholds: when a signal
is ambiguous, Stage A's label survives. Pure function, no I/O, no
RNG.

      above the cohort median. Verses at cohort median or lower
      qualify; a section whose median rises above the cohort is

    """Compute new ``type`` overrides for section transitions.

    Returns a tuple of new transition-type strings (or ``None`` for
    transitions whose type is unchanged), aligned 1-to-1 with the
    input transitions. The composition layer applies the overrides
    to its concrete transition objects (dict or
    ``SectionTransition`` — either works).

    Args:
        transition_count: Number of transitions in the song. Must
            equal ``len(transitions_from_to)``.
        transitions_from_to: Sequence of ``(from_section,
            to_section)`` index pairs, one per transition.
        refined_types: Output of ``refine_section_types``. Indexed
            by section number.
        aggregates: Output of ``aggregate_song_form``. Indexed by
            section number.
        thresholds: Frozen tuning knobs.

    Returns:
        Tuple of length ``transition_count``. Entry ``i`` is the
        new ``type`` string to assign to transition ``i``, or
        ``None`` if the transition is unchanged. Defensive no-op
        on shape mismatch.
