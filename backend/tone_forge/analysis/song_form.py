"""Refine Stage A section types using per-stem song-form signals.

Stage A (``section_naming.derive_section_types``) maps H2 role
decisions onto a minimal vocabulary —
INTRO/VERSE/CHORUS/BRIDGE/OUTRO — using chord-trigram recurrence
plus position. Stage B (this module) takes that output and refines
it using per-section aggregates from
``song_form_aggregates.aggregate_song_form``:

    CHORUS + vocal_activity_score < ceiling
        → INSTRUMENTAL

    VERSE + next is CHORUS + energy_ramp_into_next > floor
        → PRECHORUS

    drum_density_z < ceiling   (and not at the song's edge)
        → BREAKDOWN

    transition.to_section's refined type is CHORUS
        + aggregates[from_section].energy_ramp_into_next > floor
        → transition.type = "buildup"

All four rules are conservative one-sided thresholds: when a signal
is ambiguous, Stage A's label survives. Pure function, no I/O, no
RNG.

Boundary
--------
Imports only ``tone_forge.analysis.sections`` (own subsystem) plus
``tone_forge.analysis.song_form_aggregates``. Does not cross the
analysis subsystem boundary.
